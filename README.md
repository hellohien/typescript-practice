# TypeScript Practice Projects

## Overview

This repository includes a collection of TypeScript exercises that I worked on to strengthen my understanding of TypeScript concepts. Each project aims to demonstrate different features of TypeScript, such as types, interfaces, classes, and asynchronous programming.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **VSCode**: My preferred code editor with TypeScript support.
